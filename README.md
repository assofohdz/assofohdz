## Everything-as-Code, even my profile!ðŸ‘‹

I love making things flow through tech. All the way from a to z. 

Since I took a masters in informatics[^DTU] I've been a developer, an architect, a scrum master and a project manager.

I am an Agile and DevOps advocate and strategist, with roots in ERP project management, architecture and development, resulting in deep experience in the entire software development process from ideation to release and adoption. 

I aim to expand and teach quality software habits: Team autonomy and organization alignment, rigorous management of technical and organizational debt, focus on flow of customer value, hypothesis driven development, live site culture, evidence gathered in production and managing infrastructure as flexible resources. To me it is important that people are brought together, processes are streamlined and that products are utilized to alleviate resources efficiently, to create value for the end customer.

I thrive working in a team, with people that can challenge me and the way of working
